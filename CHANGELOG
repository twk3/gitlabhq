v 6.0.0
  - Feature: Replace teams with group membership
    We introduce group membership in 6.0 as a replacement for teams.
    The old combination of groups and teams was confusing for a lot of people.
    And when the members of a team where changed this wasn't reflected in the project permissions.
    In GitLab 6.0 you will be able to add members to a group with a permission level for each member.
    These group members will have access to the projects in that group.
    Any changes to group members will immediately be reflected in the project permissions.
    You can even have multiple owners for a group, greatly simplifying administration.
